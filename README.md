# Christian's BA Thesis Draft

[Started in 2015](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/evernote-project-progress-invitation/) in a [public Evernote notebook](https://www.evernote.com/pub/divinedominion/zettelkastenjusticeforhedgehogs), this is the BA thesis draft Christian of Zettelkasten.de has written. 

It's made public to demonstrate how to start a Zettelkasten for a project.

You should be able to [download the project](https://github.com/Zettelkasten-Method/ba-zettelkasten-justice-for-hedgehogs/archive/master.zip) and open the `notes` folder in any decent note archive program like [_The Archive_](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/).
