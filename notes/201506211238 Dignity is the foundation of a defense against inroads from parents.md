Care ethics fits our intuition nicely: if the relationship is not one of mutual support, it is allowed to break with our parents. This seems to be quite a good rule of thumb, but it doesn't make breaking bonds operationizable: it doesn't provide criteria to decide whether the description applies to our case.

We can turn to Jeske to find out more about the conditions of a supportive relationship.

Jeske states that familial bonds are tied through intimacy. The relationship between parent and child is just a special case of a relationship not unlike friendship. It takes time to develop, and it takes energy to maintain. Biology alone doesn't suffice to ground special obligations in familial relationships according to Jeske.

So if intimacy like in friendship is the key to familial obligations, a non-supportive relationship to one's parents may be characterized as one lacking intimacy, which is grounded in understanding.

When parents force their children to actions against their own will, especially if they are adults, the relationship clearly lacks a friendship-like grounding.

Even if we said, like Kant did, that sometime we're supporting our friends best when we do things they don't seem to like, we still have to take into account their autonomy to uphold a relationship which respects both parties's dignity.

That's where Dworkin, Jeske, and claims of care ethics according to Manning converge: the individual's exclusive right to chose for her own which lifestyle suits her the best is the foundation for a concept of dignity. A person's dignity shall not be allowed to be violated, and it is just to defend against such infringements, even frome one's parents, even if they claimed their actions are to one's benefit.
