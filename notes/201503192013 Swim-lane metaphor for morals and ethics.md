# 201503192013 Swim-lane metaphor for morals and ethics

Dworkin uses the metaphor of swim lanes in his theory.\[371\][#dworkin2011just] The metaphor conveys the intention of not interfering with somebody else's life without good reasons. You need to worry about your performance in life, swimming in your own lane.

In ethics: how do you find out how well you did swim? -- Judging the quality of your performance.

In moral: sets the boundaries of the swim lanes, that is, what's your life about? Generally, you should stay in your own lane. It may be allowed to cross lanes, though. When is it appropriate to cross lanes in order to help someone? Also, it's never allowed to cross lanes in order to harm someone.\[288\]\[#dworkin2011just\]
