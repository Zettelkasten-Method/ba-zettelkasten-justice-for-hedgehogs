# 201506251022 Hedgehog's faith that moral truth equals coherent values

"We can seek truth about morality only by pursuing coherence endorsed by conviction."\[120\]\[#dworkin2011just\]

That's the hedgehog's faith: "all true values form an interlocking network", and "each of our convictions about what is good or right or beautiful plays some role in supporting each of our other convictions in each of those domains of value."\[120\]\[#dworkin2011just\]
