#care #awareness #dignity #god

Care ethics is rooted in everyday reasoning instead of transcendental ideals like God or dignity. Neither of those two have a high stand nowadays anyway. Real needs of real people are important.[chapter 4][#manning1992fem]

Care ethics in grounded in "care", and "to care for".[61f][#manning1992fem]

"Care" is dispositional. Care entails we raise our awareness for the needs of fellow human beings. It's the responsibility to be a caring person. Care ethics is highly contextualized because momentary analysises and high awareness play a prominent role. There are no hard rules, like in deontology.

"To care for" means to respond to the needs of other persons, animals, groups, values, or objects. It's the acting out of the disposition.
