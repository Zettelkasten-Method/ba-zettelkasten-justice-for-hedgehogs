Product value is a value inherent to an object in its existence. Performance value is a value connected to its coming-about.[197][#dworkin2011just]

Dworkin applies this distinction to the value of a life. If someone lives a life in contemplation, say, then it may be a life which subjectively feels good. This can be called the product value of a life. But in judging someone's life, we tend to attach objective value to the ripples her life creates, to the amount of change in the world, and thus refer to the performance value.[198][#dworkin2011just]

In the same vein, product value doesn't matter to make the world a better place: more people don't equal a better world. The performance value of lives is highly unequal, so some lives lived were worth more than others.[205][#dworkin2011just]
