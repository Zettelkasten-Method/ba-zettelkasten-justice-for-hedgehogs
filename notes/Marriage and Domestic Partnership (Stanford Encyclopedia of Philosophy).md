# Marriage and Domestic Partnership (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)

Hegel commented that arranged marriage is the most ethical form of marriage because it subordinates personal choice to the institution. The institutional view holds that the purpose of the institution defines its obligations, taking precedence over spouses' desires, either, in the two most prominent forms, in the service of a procreative union, or to protect spousal love. These theories have implications for the moral status of extra-marital sex and divorce, as well as the point and purpose of marriage.
