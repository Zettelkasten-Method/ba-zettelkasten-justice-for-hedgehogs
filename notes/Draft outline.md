# Draft outline

**Introduction: Should we be allowed to disagree and break with our families?**

- The case of 18-year old Nasser, sueing his parents for trying to abduct him and force-marry to someone he didn't care about
    -   §201505251140 Nasser's Case 
    -   §201505202128 Concept Forced Marriage
- While it's necessary to look at his parent's claims to fully understand the situation, it isn't necessary to understand their point in order to judge Nasser's actions. 
    -   Not the truth of Nasser's convictions or that of his parents are important. Their coherent set of convictions matters monstly.
    -   §201506251030 How to live: Responsibility for our lives VS Accuracy of moral convictions
    -   How can we resolve the issue that both parties may be equally convinced in and equally morally responsible for their actions? 
    -   \-- We will turn to authenticity, and owning one's live, and that Nasser's parents violate the principle of non-harmful interfering.
    -   §201503192013 Swim-lane metaphor for morals and ethics
    -   §201503230933 Concept authenticity
- We have to understand his point of view and his system of values first and foremost. It doesn't make sense to try and force an external template onto a complex interpretive system. (We'll see why that is so.) 
    -   §201506120831 Interpretations have truth-value
- What does it mean to marry someone, anyway?
    -   §200910011300 Concept Institution
    -   §200912061046 Concept social role
    -   §201506211426 What is marriage?

<p align="start">Dworkin doesn't get specific enough in his theory. Re-interpreting care ethic's justification of breaking with your family in Dworkin's terms. (They are compatible, but the foundation differs.)
<p align="start">§201506211238 Dignity is the foundation of a defense against inroads from parents</p></p>

<p align="start">Nasser's parents seem to care from their own point of view, but they don't seem to care in a way which takes his personality into account. They want to form him instead of respect him.</p></p>

4\. So is Nasser universally justified in his actions?

- Dworkin tells us that his theory doesn't depend on a particular community. But you can say we're never independent from our upbringing intellectually ("Standortgebundenheit"). So is Dworkin a child of western philosophy only and does his theory not have power over eastern culture?
    -   Respecting other people's lives is coherent with the foundation of individualism. An upbringing in a culture which doesn't put an emphasis on the individual will make most of Dworkin's foundation unplausible.
    -   Cultural upbringing as the foundation of our values: 
    -   §201506260941 There can be moral argument between cultures
    -   §201506281130 Teaching is okay
    -   §201506250955 Shared responsibility
    -   But his method may survive: they, too, may argue in favor of coherence, only they won't accept the underlying convictions of Dworkin, the westerner.
    -   Nasser may or may not care much about his parent's upbringing as he, too, is a child of western ideology.
    -   If Nasser truly cared about his parents, we should ask him if sueing his father was the only way to express discontent with his actions, the only way to liberate from his parent's claims. 
    -   He is justified to go separate ways. 
    -   The question turns into one of measure: did he have to go this far, or would a less severe defense have sufficed?
