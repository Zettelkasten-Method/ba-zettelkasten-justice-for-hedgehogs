# 201505221337 Draft outline

**Introduction: Should we be allowed to disagree and break with our families?**

- The case of 18-year old Nasser, sueing his parents for trying to abduct him and force-marry to someone he didn't care about
    - [[201505251140]] Nasser's Case
    - [[201505202128]] Concept Forced Marriage
- While it's necessary to look at his parent's claims to fully understand the situation, it isn't necessary to understand their point in order to judge Nasser's actions.
    - Not the truth of Nasser's convictions or that of his parents are important. Their coherent set of convictions matters monstly.
    - [[201506251030]] How to live: Responsibility for our lives VS Accuracy of moral convictions
    - How can we resolve the issue that both parties may be equally convinced in and equally morally responsible for their actions? 
        - We will turn to authenticity, and owning one's live, and that Nasser's parents violate the principle of non-harmful interfering.
    - [[201503192013]] Swim-lane metaphor for morals and ethics
    - [[201503230933]] Concept authenticity
- We have to understand his point of view and his system of values first and foremost. It doesn't make sense to try and force an external template onto a complex interpretive system. (We'll see why that is so.) 
    - [[201506120831]] Interpretations have truth-value
- What does it mean to marry someone, anyway?
    - [[200910011300]] Concept Institution
    - [[200912061046]] Concept social role
    - [[201506211426]] What is marriage?

**Useful Concepts in \*Justice for Hedgehogs* and Care Ethics**

- Role and weight of tradition in Dworkin's theory; moral is no subject to a community
    - [[201506251022]] Hedgehog's faith that moral truth equals coherent values
    - [[201506260926]] Values are interpretive
- Dworkin's concept of dignity, responsibility to ourselves and others 
    - [[201503231000]] Concept dignity
    - [[201503231003]] Concept self-respect
    - [[201506120902]] Product value -- Performance value
    - [[201503230933]] Concept authenticity
    - [[201503240856]] Responsibility equals psychological coherence and attribution to oneself
    - [[201506251006]] Responsibility requires interpretation and claiming ownership of one's life
- Dworkin's concept of associative obligations
    - [[201505251242]] Kinds of Obligations
    - [[201506211107]] Special obligations
    - [[201505251218]] Concept Role Obligation
    - [[201506041035]] Associations
    - [[201506041156]] Responsibility necessitates associations
    - [[201506041026]] Our special responsibility in associations
- Looking at care ethics: why it's okay to pay no respect to your parents' claims if your family is non-supportive 
    - [[201504070954]] Care ethics according to Manning
    - [[201506211315]] Compromise and dignity

**Justifying Nasser's Actions**

- Dworkin doesn't get specific enough in his theory. Re-interpreting care ethic's justification of breaking with your family in Dworkin's terms. (They are compatible, but the foundation differs.)
    - [[201506211238]] Dignity is the foundation of a defense against inroads from parents
- Pay attention to your own life and your "performance" first as long as you do no harm to others 
    - [[201504090836]] Obligations towards family through affection
    - [[201506251030]] How to live: Responsibility for our lives VS Accuracy of moral convictions
- Pondering parents' demands: what justifies them? What doesn't? 
    - [[201506260926]] Values are interpretive
    - [[201506120831]] Interpretations have truth-value
    - [[201504090830]] Making a true compromise results in more care
    - Nasser's parents seem to care from their own point of view, but they don't seem to care in a way which takes his personality into account. They want to form him instead of respect him.

**So is Nasser universally justified in his actions?**

- Dworkin tells us that his theory doesn't depend on a particular community. But you can say we're never independent from our upbringing intellectually ("Standortgebundenheit"). So is Dworkin a child of western philosophy only and does his theory not have power over eastern culture?
    - Respecting other people's lives is coherent with the foundation of individualism. An upbringing in a culture which doesn't put an emphasis on the individual will make most of Dworkin's foundation unplausible.
    - Cultural upbringing as the foundation of our values: 
    - [[201506260941]] There can be moral argument between cultures
    - [[201506281130]] Teaching is okay
    - [[201506250955]] Shared responsibility
    - But his method may survive: they, too, may argue in favor of coherence, only they won't accept the underlying convictions of Dworkin, the westerner.
    - Nasser may or may not care much about his parent's upbringing as he, too, is a child of western ideology.
    - If Nasser truly cared about his parents, we should ask him if sueing his father was the only way to express discontent with his actions, the only way to liberate from his parent's claims. 
    - He is justified to go separate ways. 
    - The question turns into one of measure: did he have to go this far, or would a less severe defense have sufficed?
