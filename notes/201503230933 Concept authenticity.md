# 201503230933 Concept authenticity

One has to find out what makes one's one life a successful life, define what "success" means, and work towards that goal coherently. That's the special responsibility we have to take for our lives.

She who lives with authenticity can only agree to those ways of living which are not a waste of  opportunities from her vantage point. \[according to Sen\][#sen2010igel]  There is no objectively best career path, and there's no objectively best gender to bond with.

\> Each person has a special, personal responsibility for identifying what counts as success in his own life; he has a personal responsibility to create that life through a coherert narrative or style that he himself endorses.\[204\]\[#dworkin2011just\]

Authenticity is the other side of self-respect: because you respect yourself, it matters which ways of living you chose. You develop a life-style.

From there it follows that:\[210\]\[#dworkin2011just\]

- one has to take responsibility for each of one's actions and is not allowed to ascribe responsibility to external causes
- one has to deal with the cost and consequences of one's decisions; he who delegates responsibility to others acts without dignity
