# 201506251006 Responsibility requires interpretation and claiming ownership of one's life
#responsibility #interpretation

"[I]nterpretations knit values together"[101][#dworkin2011just] -- We have to make sense of our convictions through reflection and bring them into a coherent web. This is a moral imperative, because without doing so, we are not morally responsible,. Moral responsibility is the foundation for authenticity, to claim ownership of our lives.[210][#dworkin2011just] Dworkin calls it a moral virtue.

So responsibility is a twofold requirement:

1. It is necessary to have the moral virtue of responsibility to claim integrity or authenticity for one's life. In this sense, responsibility focuses on our actions and the story of our lives.

2. Moral responsibility is also a prerequisite to creating the foundation of our lives' stories: the system of values, formed through interpretation and argument. Without this integrated system of convictions, we cannot live authentic lives.
