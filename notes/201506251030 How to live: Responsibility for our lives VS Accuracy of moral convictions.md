# 201506251030 How to live: Responsibility for our lives VS Accuracy of moral convictions

Usually, philosophers try to find out when moral convictions are accurate and in line with a universal truth. Dworkin instead argues for moral responsibility, to claim ownership of one's values and act according to them.\[102\]\[#dworkin2011just\]

- This is the foundation of authenticity. §201503230933

According to the realist's view, moral convictions are accurate if they are universally true. Dworkin argues both that there's no reason to believe in external truth-makers or "morons" is morals, and that it wouldn't even help if it were otherwise. To find the morons which make our convictions true, we'd have to find out which convictions are true first. Without truth-makers which can demonstrate truth and falsity of convictions, there's no accuracy to be had.

Instead of accuracy, Dworkin argues in favor of responsibility. Our convictions aren't \_just\_ true, but they are true in context of our system of values, their coherence.

- §201506251022 Hedgehog's faith that moral truth equals coherent values

Responsibility entails that we have good reasons to hold on to our convictions. Instead of arguing for the truth of our convictions, we make them plausible. There are convictions which don't stand this test, but these have to be either integrated or thrown out in order to maintain responsibility.
