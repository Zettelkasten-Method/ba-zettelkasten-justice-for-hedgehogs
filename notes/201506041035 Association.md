Associations are risky relationships which make us open for a special kind of benefit and make us vulnerable to a special kind of harm.

Sexual intimacy is an association.[312][#dworkin2011just] Intimacy is characterized by excluding others -- from secrets, and from sharing personal vulnerabilities. Sexual intimacy is also characterized by mutually exclusive agreements to not have sexual intercourse with others. So both partners refrain from sharing the joys of having sex with other people. That's the benefits of trust and intimacy in sexual relationships. Meanwhile, if one partners breaks the rules of intimacy, the other is going to be badly hurt.

Political associations are another example.[320][#dworkin2011just] To participate in a democracy will raise questions about justice: what penalties are we allowed to inflict upon each other? How much tax paying can the poor handle?
