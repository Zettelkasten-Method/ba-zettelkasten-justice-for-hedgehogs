In care ethics, compromises are important: they're not the way out with the highest computable utility, but they are better inasmuch as to make a compromises it is necessary that both parties are open to each other's interests and needs. A compromise is a solution with a higher awareness for the needs of our fellow humans.

When the best solution is the one which takes the interests of all parties involved into account, we have to make real compromises, sometimes, as opposed to making a compromise for the sake of making a compromise, or as an easier way out of a difficult situation. It's mor e important to take everyone's needs into account than making a compromise per se.[141][#manning1992fem]

A compromise can deter from the best possible solution for the sake of feeling well: at least no one's feelings seem to be hurt. That's not a good motivation.

In a conflict, opening oneself up for the needs of the other party can result in being able to value them again. If they don't play their part of making a true compromise, it is allowed to ignore their expectations completely. Without mutuality, a compromise doesn't work.[105][#manning1992fem] It seems to be better to care for yourself first if the other refuses to do.

It would work just as well to say that not taking a compromise into account simply violates the other party's dignity: you'd ignore their needs to make their life a successful one according to their terms. (Of course abstract concepts like dignity have no place in care ethics.)
