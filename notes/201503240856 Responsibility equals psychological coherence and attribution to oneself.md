# 201503240856 Responsibility equals psychological coherence and attribution to oneself
#responsibility #attribution #dignity #coherence #decision

We can understand responsibility for decisions and actions by looking what things find their way into our psychologic self: emotion and keeping everything coherent.

All conditions for living a successful life, which is an authentic life, can be found in mental states of a person. One would live a life without dignity if one would attribute responsibility to external causes exclusively.

The origin of a decision doesn't matter at all for its weight and value. Only the feeling of coherence counts. Decisions may be in part determined by external factors, but these cannot replace decisions themselves. 

Both natural causes and volitional acts function similarly to our minds.[book 2, part 3, §1, p. 407][#hume1978treatise]

For example, if I were a fan of Justin Bieber, my decision to visit the Ringlokschuppen in Bielefeld for a concert will depend on Justin Bieber announcing a concert there. Without an announcement, which is not in my power, I wouldn't visit the venue. But the announcement didn't cause my visiting the place at a particular date and time.

Decisions become important to our lives and become genuinely _ours_ by reflecting our desires, plans, and convictions. We attribute decisions to ourselves and take responsibility for them because they fit our mental state. Conversely, decisions which do not fit out mental state are of no value to us.

> [T]he thesis of Justice for Hedgehogs is this: what a person has reason to want is an authentic life – one that accords with and reflects the decisions he or she makes about how to live, and in which these decisions themselves reflect his or her desires, plans, and convictions and are based on true beliefs about the world.[607][#scanlon2010resp]

The notion of "true beliefs" rules out misinformed people and some of those with serious mental disorders.

Only decisions with personal weight and value have meaning for social life: others react to this kind of decision with praise or admonition. If I were too mentally ill, no such reaction would be considered appropriate; instead, people would attribute my actions to my special condition. This has consequences for people bonding with me and creating obligations.
