Self-respect entails that our way of living is genuinely important to us. It is the foundation of  being able to live a good life in dignity:

> Each person must take his own life seriously: he must accept that it is a matter of importance that his lie be a successful performance rather than a wasted opportunity.[203][#dworkin2011just]

The principle of self-respect requires that we care about our way of living, so we should strive to make a higher impact, to increase the performance value of our lives. We should want to make our lives successful.
