# 201505251242 Kinds of special Obligations

Dworkin recognizes two kinds of special obligation:

1\. Performative obligation, which is the case for example when we promise something to somebody. They are called thus because we need to act in a certain way (performance) to form the obliagtion: "we make some people special through datable and voluntary acts like making a promise to them."\[301\]\[#dworkin2011just\]

2\. Associative obligation, which is the case when we're in a special kind of personal relationship to somebody. It's called thus because the mere relationship to another person suffices to give rise to obliagtion. It's not called "personal" or "relationship obligation" because Dworkin recognizes citizenship as one kind of relevant association.\[301\]\[#dworkin2011just\]
