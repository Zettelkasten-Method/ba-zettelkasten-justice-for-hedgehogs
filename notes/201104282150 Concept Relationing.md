Relationing

: shows the attachment of knowledge to being ("Seinsverbundenheit"), its historical and social genesis[cf 670][#mannheim1931wisss]

: particularizes univeral claims

: doesn't make a statement about truthiness of the knowledge, opposed to relativizing.[vgl 667][#mannheim1931wisss]

Seinsverbundenheit §200905271907

Relativizing §201210250918

When you are relationing, you look for the foundation of knowledge in its cultural-historical components. Something can still be true for the groups affected by that knowledge.
