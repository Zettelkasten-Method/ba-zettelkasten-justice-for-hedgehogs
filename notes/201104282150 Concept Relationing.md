# 201104282150 Concept Relationing

Relationing

: shows the attachment of knowledge to being ("Seinsverbundenheit"), its historical and social genesis\[cf 670\]\[#mannheim1931wisss\]

: particularizes univeral claims

: doesn't make a statement about truthiness of the knowledge, opposed to relativizing.\[vgl 667\]\[#mannheim1931wisss\]

Seinsverbundenheit §200905271907

Relativizing §201210250918

When you are relationing, you look for the foundation of knowledge in its cultural-historical components. Something can still be true for the groups affected by that knowledge.
