# 201504090836 Obligations towards family through affection

In care ethics, Manning grounds special obligations towards family members in affection. ("ties of affection"\[105\]\[#manning1992fem\]). Through a natural want to care comes the obligation.

Expectations and a shared history become important only in second instance. The true motivational force is the care for the other.

It's always a bad thing to break familial bonds, but sometimes it's necessary to do so: if the family doesn't support you as a person with her own interests but instead treats you like a means to their end.\[105\]\[#manning1992fem\]

Self-actualizarion has precedence over maintaining familial bonds. Manning wouldn't call it self-actualization of realizing one's dreams, but rather care for oneself.
