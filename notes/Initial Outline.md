# Initial Outline

1\. Introduction: Should we be allowed to disagree and break with our families?

     * The case of 18-year old Nasser, sueing his parents for trying to abduct him and force-marry to someone

2\. Useful Concepts in \*Justice for Hedgehogs* and Care Ethics

     * Role and weight of tradition in Dworkin's theory; moral is no subject to a community

     * Dworkin's concept of dignity, responsibility to ourselves and others

     * Dworkin's concept of associative obligations

     * Looking at care ethics: why it's okay to pay no respect to your parents' claims if your family is non-supportive

3\. Justifying Nasser's Actions

     * Pay attention to your own life and your "performance" first as long as you do no harm to others

     * Pondering parents' demands: what justifies them? What doesn't?

     * Dworkin doesn't get specific enough in his theory. Re-interpreting care ethic's justification of breaking with your family in Dworkin's terms. (They are compatible, but the foundation differs.)

4\. So is Nasser universally justified in his actions?

     * Dworkin tells us that his theory doesn't depend on a particular community. But you can say we're never independent from our upbringing intelectually ("Standortgebundenheit"). So is Dworkin a child of western philosophy oly and does his theory not have power over eastern culture?

     * Why Nasser might not care about this at all: he was raised under European influence and his parent's values don't apply because he says so.
