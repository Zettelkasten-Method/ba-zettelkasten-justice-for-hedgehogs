# 201506041026 Our special responsibility in associations
#responsibility #association #dignity

We have a special responsibility to those we're in close relationships with because these relationships make both parties more vulnerable to each other.[312][#dworkin2011just] Â ntimacy is the key component.

Associations are risky relationships because they make us vulnerable for a special kind of harm, even when they make us open for a special kind of benefit.

It is permissive to be more vulnerable to some people when this vulnerability is met with a heightened concern for oneself. The other party should care. Without reciprocity, one's dignity is compromised in principle. Even when the other party inflicts no harm, her unilateral power over one's well-being is in conflict with the second principle of dignity, namely that we ourselves should take full responsibility for our lives.
