# 201506250945 Moral responsibility necessitates coherent convictions
#coherence #responsibility #rationality

We should try to create a well-working filter for influences on our decision-making, so that our decisions are grounded in our values instead of our tastes and emotions. This is a moral filter, which is created by a coherent web of convictions. These convictions are backed by reason: we can argue for them. Consequently, they aren't superficial and cannot be contradictory, for contradicting convictions depend on superficiality and lack of reflection.[107--8][#dworkin2011just]

Moral responsibility requires us to bring our initially compartmentalized convicitions into a coherent form.[108][#dworkin2011just]

Here, Dworkin's refusal to let emotions guide our lives is clear. Reasonable convictions should guide our decision-making. However we design our lives, this design should be argued for. Simply feeling like living so and so doesn't suffice _until_ our convictions include a strong claim that this is indeed an important part of living well.
