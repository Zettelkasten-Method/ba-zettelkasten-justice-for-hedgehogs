# 20130202144800 Concept comprehensive outcome

Sen's concept of a comprehensive outcome enables us to say that a victory is \_fair\_ or an arrest is \_arbitrary\_. Taking the comprehensive outcome of actions into account, we judge an action by looking at procedural aspects of the action instead of the outcome only.\[51\]\[#sen2010ger\]

This works well together with \_nyaya\_, which is an Indian term for a particular kind of justice. Nyaya takes the state and the process into account and helps us find an answer to the question "How should we live?"\[15, 53\]\[#sen2010ger\]

\[#sen2010ger\]: Amartya Sen (2010): Die Idee der Gerechtigkeit, MÃ¼nchen: C. H. Beck.
