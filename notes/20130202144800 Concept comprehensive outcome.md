Sen's concept of a comprehensive outcome enables us to say that a victory is _fair_ or an arrest is _arbitrary_. Taking the comprehensive outcome of actions into account, we judge an action by looking at procedural aspects of the action instead of the outcome only.[51][#sen2010ger]

This works well together with _nyaya_, which is an Indian term for a particular kind of justice. Nyaya takes the state and the process into account and helps us find an answer to the question "How should we live?"[15, 53][#sen2010ger]
