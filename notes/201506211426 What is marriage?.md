# 201506211426 What is marriage?

What is marriage?

Though this isn't a paper about marriage, we need to agree on some baseline in order to proceed with the analysis of Nasser's case.

I want to find a pragmatic concept of marriage which satisfies the following criteria:

- point out the consequences: what does marriage change? How do we treat someone we're married to differently than foreigners; what kinds of claims can our spouse[^singspouse] make?
- strength of the bond: what's the difference between marriage and sharing someone's car? In what respect is the former a stronger bond than the latter?

We can rule out political, sexual, or religious aspects for now, even love. In this context, marriage is of concern to us as an institution only, and as a change of the base of our decisions.

The weight of the consequences of marrying someone entail that no one should be force-married. Forcing violates the principles of dignity. And being forced into marriage has long-lasting consequences. It changes a life tremednously. Forcing your child into marriage is a very large infringement of your child's self-actualization.

\## Legal implications

We vow, which constitutes the promise-like character, but we also enter a legal relationship with our spouse. This has strong implications for our lives. That alone does make marriage a serious thing, and not a change in lifestyle to take lightly.

\## Promise

To marry entails making a promise, literally: I vow to spend my life with you until I withdraw or am released from the promise. What "spending my life with you" means will vary. Exclusivity and a strong expectation to not disengage lightly are part of the institution. Some details may be up to us to decide as there's a leeway of interpretation.

As a promise which can never be fulfilled, our actions will have to be judged differently from the marriage onward. We have to take the welfare of our spouse into account until death or divorce. Even if we don't feel like it. That and more could be part of the promise, depending on our concrete expectations.

Marriage as an institution has consequences for our lives through the eyes of others. Institutional expectations on one hand lay the foundation of our own expectations. On the other hand, they are shared among our peers. Social pressure will make it more likely to keep the promise even if our intrinsic motivation ceases. No one will ask my spouse if it's okay for her that I make out with someone else; it's just expected that it's not.

Breaking promises will diminish trust people put in you, given others find out about it. Breaking the marital promise is more likely to become wider spread information.

\## Exclusivity

Once you're married, you cannot marry again until disengagement. There's just a single slot for a spouse in your life at any point in time, so to speak. Getting married is intended to be a change for a lifetime. Here, intention and practice diverge, as the divorce rate indicates. It's okay to get married multiple times in most western societies, but only in succession. (The motto is "Forever, for the time being"; "Erst mal f√ºr immer")

\## Association and Special Obligation

Marriage is a kind of association. Formally, it is backed by a promise. The contents of the promise determine the consequences in cases of unvoluntary marriage together with legal obligations. Without the will to marry, there's no special obligation.

Informally, even more so under circumstances of freely choosing a spouse, marriage is also backed by caring. Intimacy is the basis for special obligations in friendship and family, and it roots in caring. Intimacy has to grow, and is usually considered a prerequisite instead of a consequence. It cannot be forced. (Although both spouses may suffer the same from their forced marriage and end up becoming partners in and through their suffering.) Without intimacy, there're hardly special obligations.

\[^singspouse\]: Although there are cultures which tolerate or even expect polygamy, for the sake of Nasser in Lebanon and Germany, it suffices to talk about monogamous marriage and having a single spouse only.
