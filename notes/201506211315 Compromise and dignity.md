A compromise, as sketched by care ethics, can be translated to Dworkin's theory:

When we're in conflict with someone, we have to take the interest of the other person into account. We have to respect their needs. It is not allowed to simply override what they want. This is because fellow human beings have dignity and a right to design their life according to their own terms.

A compromise for the sake of mKing a compromise or as the easier way out should not be taken lightly: we also have to maintain out self-respect, that is holding up our own dignity and defend against inroads from others. We just have as much right to design our lives to our own liking. (As long as we harm no one.)
