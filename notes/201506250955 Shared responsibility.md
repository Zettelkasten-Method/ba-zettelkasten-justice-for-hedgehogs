The burden of moral interpretation lies on everyone's shoulders, but it needn't be carried alone: it is our duty to strive for a coherent web of values and convictions.

We start our lives with a shared language and a shared understanding of values.\[109\][#dworkin2011just] This eases bringing convictions into a coherent system.
