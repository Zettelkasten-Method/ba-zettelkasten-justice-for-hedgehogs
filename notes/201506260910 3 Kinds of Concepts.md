# 201506260910 3 Kinds of Concepts

We can distinguish criterial from natural-kind from interpretive concepts.\[158--162\]\[#dworkin2011just\]

We share a concept when we use the same criteria to identify them. We use the same test to find out whether something is an instance of the concept in question. Expanding the set of criteria for "bound blank paper notebook" by a few may result in "a novel". We can list common and differing criteria to find answers to the question "What is a book?".

Instances of natural-kind concepts are identified by decisive tests, too. They amount more to a moment of evidence of the substantial essence instead of comparing an object to a catalogue of criteria. If simply "seeing" doesn't suffice, there may be a more intricate test, like using a chemical process to identify components, but there will be tests nevertheless. Dworkin's example of analyzing an animals DNA to find out whether it's a lion is such a test: we need no additional criteria. The DNA is exemplary of a scientific essence. Natural-kind concepts amount to single-component tests.

Both disagreement about criterial and natural-kind concepts can be solved. Nowadays, it often suffices to consult Wikipedia from your smartphone to end a dispute.

Interpretive concepts, on the other hand, are not decisive by nature. There's no universally accepted test, because devising a test would itself depend on one's interpretation of the concept. This gives rise to disagreement and argument which cannot be solved by looking up a definition on Wikipedia or the rest of the internet. These are questions like "What is fair?".

Interpetive concepts are based on interpretation "all the way down"\[162\]\[#dworkin2011just\]: there's so non-interpretive foundation to be found.

In that sense, political and other value-based debates are no simple misunderstandings.\[162\]\[#dworkin2011just\]
