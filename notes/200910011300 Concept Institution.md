When two people recognize recurring actions as types of actions, and when this typification is reciprocal, that is, both share this assessment. Institutions are like agreements, only implicit. You perform actions and someone else forms justified expectations about your behavior in certain situations. That's habitualization; and if your concrete actions vary while being of a common type, we've got typification.[#berger-luckmann1980sozkon][]

> Institutionalization occurs whenever there is a reciprocal typification of habitualized actions by types of actors. Put differently, any such typification is an institution.[53][#berger1966con]

Bundles of expectations of a social role which survive the test of time. It doesn't matter who is playing the role, it only matters that the expectations attached to that role are satisfied.

- §200912060449 social role

Institutions are bound to expectations. They make orienting on role expectations reliable.[cf 104][#luhmann1971polplan]

Even though there might not be anyone actually enforcing certain behavior through punishment, say, you have to worry far less about the outcome of a choice someone in a certain role will make. Given a set of options to act, and given an institution, the outcome will far more likely match the institutional expectations. This reduces uncertainty in deciding what to do in the light of other actors around us tremendously. When established social roles and institutions come to play, things roll smoother.
