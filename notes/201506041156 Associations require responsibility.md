# 201506041156 Associations require responsibility

Only those decisions I deem my own, those which fit my mental state, my plans and convictions, are the basis for forming associations. If other people would not think I'm responsible for my decisions and actions, they wouldn't bond with me.

In the case of severe mental illness, there's still a relationship of doctor or caregiver and patient. These are no associations, though. I would expect my mother to still love me, but under certain conditions, even that could become a case of conflict with her dignity. She must not make herself vulnerable to my abusing or exploiting her love to live in accordance with the second principle of dignity.

In order to form associations with other people, I have to be able to take care of myself and to live a life in dignity. (Is she who suffers from severe mental illness not capable of living a life in dignity according to Scanlon?)
