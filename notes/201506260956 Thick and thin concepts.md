# 201506260956 Thick and thin concepts

According to Bernard Williams, moral concepts can be located on a scale from thick to thin.\[180--2\]\[#dworkin2011just\]

Moral rightness and wrongness are thin concepts: they are sufficiently abstract to be applied to every value judgement in the realm of morality. They are still moral judgements themselves, like "this was wrong!"

Thick concepts carry the description of things they apply to with them. Virtues like bravery are among Dworkin's examples. If an action is called brave, this judgement may only be applied to a limited subset of actions, namely those which fit the description of bravery. Thus, thick moral concepts are more concrete, more limited in scope, and since their descriptions may contradict one another, they are more or less distinct from one another. It doesn't make sense to call a charitable act cowardly.\[181\]\[#dworkin2011just\]

Thick concepts aren't made up of criterial concepts with an emotional weight. They are interpretive concepts themselves and the very basis for the values they describe.\[182\]\[#dworkin2011just\]
