# 201503211115 Interpretative understanding of morality rules out utilitarism

Consequentialism cannot work with interpretative concepts in morality.

Utilitarism uses the scientific method of quantifiability as a foundation of moral. The utility (or pleasure) of actions is measured. It is accepted that what is measured is itself not part of the moral system.

According to Dworkin, this concept of morals cannot be used because it refers to factors outside the sphere or system of morals and ethics. Measurable things in the world are used instead.

Only criteria immanent to a system of morals can be used, because moral concepts are interpretative, and interpretation always happens from within. It's impossible to reach an objective end state, since due to interpretation, everything flows.

If someone uses external criteria, she violates the nature of moral concepts.\[273\]\[#dworkin2011just\]
