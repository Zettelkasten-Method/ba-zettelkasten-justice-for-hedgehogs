# 201506120831 Interpretations have truth-value
#truth #interpretation

Interpretations can be true or false, just like scientific claims. Using any other other difference than true/false, for example reasonable/unreasonable, is useless in practice. [151][#dworkin2011just]

Dworkin's point is this: not the eligibility for truth but the content of both systems of concepts, that is the system of moral versus the system of scientific claims, delineates one from the other. Science doesn't have exclusive right to truth.

Usually, interpretation is considered highly subjective, while truth is considered to be an objective value exclusive to science. Fittingly, interpretive propositions aren't "barely true". They depend on a system of values and are true only in respect to them.[153--4][#dworkin2011just] Dworkin calls this a holistic approach.

Conversely, convergence of interpretations are highly accidental because their foundation is shaky: since there is no bare truth, every truth we obtain is contingent.[155][#dworkin2011just]
