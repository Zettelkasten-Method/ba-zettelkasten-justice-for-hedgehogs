# 201505251140 Nasser's Case

15-year old Nasser and his parents lived in Berlin, Germany. Nasser runs from home after he tells them about his homesexuality.

Once he returns home, but only to find out a marriage was arranged to a Libanese. He runs again, tells the authorities he's being abused so his parents lose their parental rights.

Again, he returns home for a visit more recently. His father abducts him, intending to take him to Lebanon. At the border to Romania, the father is being arrested.

Upon returning to Berlin, Nasser reports his father to the police. He's now 18 years old.

In the interview, he says he did so both for the sake of his own peace of mind and for making cases such as his publicly aware.
