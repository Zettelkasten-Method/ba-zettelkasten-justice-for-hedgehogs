If moral argument is possible with cultures that don't share your concepts and convictions, and if one way to solve the conflict is through education, it's only a matter of time before someone begins to shout "colonialism!"

Dworkin doesn't simply want to export western values to less developed countries, though. His point is more profound: it's a matter of utmost importance of having convictions to defend them, and to stand in for your values. If your values entail to defend the weak, then you've got no choice but apply it to weak people in different cultures as well.

There are strong moral concepts like "justice" which will need a lot of work to be taught if not present, and even more if conflicting concepts have to be discussed. There's nothing inherently wrong in teaching. We do it all the time. As soon as you enter an argument, you become a teacher of sorts: you argue in favor of your position, so under the governance of reason, the other party will have to learn to better defend or to change their mind. You teach your children. Teaching is part of authentic self-expression.
