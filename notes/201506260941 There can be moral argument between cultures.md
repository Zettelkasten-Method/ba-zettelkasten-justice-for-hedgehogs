# 201506260941 There can be moral argument between cultures

There's no room for relativism in Dworkin's udnerstanding of interpretive concepts among cultures and languages. If one thing is unjust in one culture, it should be similarly unjust in every other. Just like we teach our children to adopt certain values, we can suppose that it's logically possible for other cultures to understand them. It will need a different kind of effort, though.

To Dworkin, being able to translate a term to "justice" presupposes enough similarity in concepts to argue about its interpretation.\[171\]\[#dworkin2011just\]

Different cultures may apply the concept of justice differently, but that doesn't make it right for them. If we share a coarse understanding of the concept, but discriminate women while we don't, or prohibit slavery while we get rich from it, one of us will be wrong in either case. It takes moral argument to find out who's right.

If a culture doesn't seem to have the concept at all, its member's actions can still be unjust according to the concept of everyone else. Dworkin's explanation is very short, and there's no formal argument except that someone doesn't need to have a concept of unjust actions to act unjust. It seems these people have to be educated in some way to enter a moral discourse about their actions. This presupposes that even a people without the concept of justice has values, and that a discourse about values will help give rise to new ones, like justice.

So either we share a concept and argue about its interpretive concents, or one of us doesn't and has to be taught to reflect on his actions properly. This sounds quite similar to what a child has to go through. After all, raising children to adopt certain values is an indicator that teaching unknown values is possible. We don't even need to presuppose a real of ideas or "morons" which we teach a child to recognize.
